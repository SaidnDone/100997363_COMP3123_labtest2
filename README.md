^ This screenshot shows the weather in the city of Toronto with other information presented at the bottom which are the city's current temperature, humidity, air pressure, minimum expected temperature and maximum expected temperature. The temperature is shown in celcius instead of kelvin which is given by the openweather API. At the bottom of the information is an icon to show how it looks in the city currently. And below that icon is a description of the current weather and the current windspeed shown in meters per secon.
